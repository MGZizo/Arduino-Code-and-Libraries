Hi,

For a small project I''m working on, I wanted to communicate with a C# application to log some data. Since the serial-over-USB connection is the de-facto connection to the Arduino, I had expected to find a messaging protocol over the serial port without any issue. This turned out to be more difficult than I had expected. On the Interfacing with software page on the Arduino Playground,  I found two mature, open and well maintained libraries, Bitlash and Firmata, which seemed to be promising at first. However, these are not quite what I am looking for: both libraries are designed to place all Arduino control at the PC side and make the Arduino into a IO component, and this is not what I want.

When looking for a library that does messaging only, I found the best option to be CmdMessenger 2. It implements
- Commands that can be sent or received
- multiple arguments can be sent together with the command
- Callback functions can be triggered on received commands

But even though it was already a pretty good piece of work, it was still lacking in some aspects. I modified so that:
- It has an asymmetrical implementation. It is now possible to send all basic data-types (char arrays, floats, ints, bytes), instead of just strings.
- It can wait for an acknowlegde command.
- It has the ability escape data. The  special characters that would be interpreted to be field separators or command separators, can now be escaped.
- It has the ability to send binary data. Using escaping, basic data-types can now be send over in binary form, for efficiency and accuracy

But most importantly, I wrote an implementation of the library for C# that runs both on .NET and Mono.  For a messaging protocol to really work, both sides need to speak it.
