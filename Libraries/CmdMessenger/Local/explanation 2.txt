When looking for a library that does messaging only, I found the best option to be CmdMessenger 2. It implements
- Commands that can be sent or received.
- multiple arguments can be appended to commands.
- Callback functions can be triggered on received commands.
- All basic data-types (char arrays, floats, ints, bytes), both for sending and receiving.
- Optional waiting for a acknowlegde commands.
- Escaping data. The special characters that would be interpreted to be field separators or command separators, can be escaped and used in arguments.
- sending as well as receiving binary data.
