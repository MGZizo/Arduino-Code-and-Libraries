!Using CmdMessenger

As of version 3, the CmdMessenger messaging library has an Arduino and .NET+Mono compatible C# implementation, and is packaged with examples of the these two sides communicating with each other. 

The library implements
#   Commands that can be sent or received.
#   Multiple arguments can be appended to commands.
#   Callback functions can be triggered on received commands.
#   All basic data-types (char arrays, floats, ints, bytes), both for sending and receiving.
#   Optional waiting for a acknowlegde commands.
#   Escaping data. The special characters that would be interpreted to be field separators or command separators, can be escaped and used in arguments.
#   Sending and receiving both plain text and binary data.
